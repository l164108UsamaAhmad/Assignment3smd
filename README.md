This was a project assignment for Software mobile development.
This was an individual project.
I made an Application named Foodies which allows you to order food online through my app and customized your food with different ingredients.
Inorder to install this application u need to have android version 4.0 and above.
You can install this app from playstore.
This app does not required any third party app in order to run.
As of now i do not have android studio in my laptop and i have installed sdk's for visual studio .net and it is not feasible for me to delete those sdks and download android studio 
again to show you images of the project as it will take alot of my time.
